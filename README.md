## Project Set-up
### 1.Clone the repository
Once you have created your repository go to your terminal then cd into the folder you desire then git clone git@github.com:your-user-name/repository-name.git
### 2.CD into your repository
Then cd into the directory example cd repository-name
### 3.Create the files you need
Then create the files needed which here we need the speed.js for the speed calculation ,grade.js for the grade calcolation and lastly net-salary.js for calculating the salary but we will be using the touch command.
### 4.Open your work int the code editor
Lastly write code to open the directory in the vs code.
### 5.Open the Program
This explains how to run the JavaScript code, whether in a browser or via Node.js.
### 6.Interact with the Program
Follow the prompts in the console or the browser to enter the required inputs and see the results.

# Student Grades Calculator
This program helps you find out a student's grade based on their marks. Just input the marks (between 0 and 100), and it’ll give you the corresponding grade according to some simple rules.

## Grading Criteria
A: 80 and above
B: 60 to 79
C: 49 to 59
D: 40 to 48
E: Below 40

## How to Use
1. Open the program in a web browser that supports JavaScript.
2. When you see the prompt, type in the student's marks (make sure it's a number between 0 and 100).
3. Hit "OK" to submit your input.
4. Check the console to see the calculated grade!

## Example
If you enter `20`, you’ll see: `Grade:E`
If you enter `85`, you’ll see: `Grade: A`

## Requirements
You just need a web browser with JavaScript enabled to run this.
 
# Speed Detector Program
## Description
This is a simple program that checks the speed of a car and calculates demerit points based on the speed limit. If the speed is below the limit, it will display "OK". If the speed exceeds the limit, it calculates the demerit points and tells the user if their license is suspended if the points exceed 12.

## Features
Prompts the user to enter the speed of the car.
Calculates and displays whether the speed is okay or the number of demerit points.
Notifies the user if their license is suspended.

## How It Works
1. The user is prompted to enter the speed of the car.
2. The program checks if the speed is below the speed limit (70 km/h).
3. If the speed is below the limit, it outputs "OK".
4. If the speed is above the limit, it calculates demerit points based on how much the speed exceeds the limit.
5. If the demerit points are greater than 12, it notifies the user that their license is suspended.

# Gross Salary Calculator

## Overview

This project is a simple Gross Salary Calculator that helps you compute your net salary after deductions like PAYE, NHIF, NSSF, and housing levy. It takes your basic salary and any additional benefits as input, then calculates your gross salary and the deductions based on the latest tax regulations in Kenya.

## Features

- Calculates gross salary by adding basic salary and benefits.
- Computes PAYE (Pay As You Earn) tax based on the current tax brackets.
- Calculates NHIF (National Hospital Insurance Fund) deductions based on salary.
- Accounts for NSSF (National Social Security Fund) contributions.
- Considers housing levy deductions for affordable housing.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the JavaScript file in your preferred code editor.
3. Run the script. You will see two prompt pop-ups asking for your inputs:
   - Enter your basic salary in Ksh (e.g., 50000)
   - Enter your total benefits in Ksh (e.g., 10000)
4. After entering the values, the program will calculate and display your gross salary and any deductions.

## Example

If you enter:
Basic Salary: `50000`
Benefits: `10000`

The program will calculate your gross salary as `60000` and provide you with the total deductions based on the PAYE, NHIF, NSSF, and housing levy rates.

## Notes

Make sure you have a JavaScript environment to run this code.
The tax rates and deduction values are based on the latest regulations as of 2024. Make sure to check for any updates or changes in the law.
